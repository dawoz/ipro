    "krautrock": "Krautrock is a musical genre that emerged in the late 1960s, mainly represented by groups from West Germany. It is a general term used for bands playing experimental, underground, psychedelic, or partly electronic types of music. Krautrock is originally a subgenre of progressive rock, but instead of following Anglo-American models of jazz and classical music, the German musicians (often inspired by the use of psychedelic drugs) created a quite different sound.The popular myth that \"Krautrock\" was coined by the English music press is not true. The first known use of the term is to be found in a Popo Music agency advertisement placed in Melody Maker (3 April 1971) and then a few weeks later in the USA Billboard magazine (29 May 1971) promoting its concert organising and artists on the Frankfurt based Bacillus label. That set the seeds for the American and British press adopting it. Initially considered insulting as the word kraut is slang for a German person, referring to the German dish \"sauerkraut\", the negative connotation disappeared as the music made by these bands since then was highly appreciated. Today, the word is honoring rather than insulting.Typical Krautrock bands in the early 1970s were Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II, Faust, Can and other bands associated with the producer/engineers: Conny Plank (Neu!, Kraftwerk and Cluster) and Dieter Dierks (Ash Ra Tempel, Tangerine Dream, etc.). Another early key-player was Rolf-Ulrich Kaiser and his Ohr, Pilz and Kosmische Musik labels. The composer Karlheinz Stockhausen also had influence on this experimental scene.Nowadays Krautrock is seen as an \"umbrella\" catch-all for the whole underground and progressive/experimental scene that developed in Germany during the 1970s and subsequent bands inspired by that unique scene.

    "funk+/+soul": "Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid to late 1960s when African-American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and R&B. Funk de-emphasizes melody and harmony and brings a strong rhythmic groove of electric bass and drums to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on chord progressions. Funk uses the same extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.Soul music is a popular music genre that originated in the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s. It combined elements of African-American gospel music, rhythm and blues, and often jazz. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States\u2014where record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax labels were influential during the period of the civil rights movement. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa.Northern Soul music was a  type of soul music that emerged from northern England in the 1960s. It was fresh, new, and upbeat (usually over 100 bpm). It was also sang by white and black people. The Northern Soul boom was between about 1965-1975. The Wigan Casino, Twisted Wheel, and Golden torch were some Northern Soul clubs, groups, and casinos that were Northern Soul hubs.Deep funk revival, naturally enough, grew out of a renewal of interest in deep (read: obscure) funk on both sides of the Atlantic, mostly among DJs and record collectors. Whether they were looking for fresh sample material or just a great overlooked dance.Retro-Soul is soul music that was made after the heyday of soul music had passed. Although deep soul had fallen out of the spotlight in the early '70s, there were a number of artists that never stopped singing in that raw style. In the mid-'80s, a small b...

    "free+jazz": "Free jazz is an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s. Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a common feature was dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz that had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Free jazz musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down jazz convention, often by discarding fixed chord changes or tempos. While usually considered avant-garde, free jazz has also been described as an attempt to return jazz to its primitive, often religious, roots and emphasis on collective improvisation.Free jazz is strongly associated with the 1950s innovations of Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor and the later works of saxophonist John Coltrane. Other important pioneers include Charles Mingus, Eric Dolphy, Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, Joe Maneri and Sun Ra. Coleman pioneered many techniques typical of free jazz, most notably his rejection of pre-written chord changes, believing instead that freely improvised melodic lines should serve as the basis for harmonic progression in his compositions. Some of bassist Charles Mingus's work was also important in establishing free jazz.Typically this kind of music is played by small groups of musicians, although some examples use larger numbers. Other forms of jazz use clear regular meters and strongly pulsed rhythms. Free jazz normally retains a general pulsation but without regular meter, and we encounter frequent accelerando and ritardando, giving an impression of the rhythm moving in waves. Previous jazz forms used harmonic structures (usually cycles of diatonic chords). Free jazz almost by definition is free of such structures, but also by definition (it is, after all, \"jazz\" as much as it is \"free\") it retains much of the language of earlier jazz playing.

    "rock": "Rock music or rock and roll in full name is a genre of popular music that originated as \"rock and roll\" in the United States in the early 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the late 1950s, 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. Its roots are in 1950s' American rock and roll when and where it first started, itself heavily influenced by rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.In its purest form, Rock & Roll has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody. Early rock & roll drew from a variety of sources, primarily blues, R&B, and country, but also gospel, traditional pop, jazz, and folk. All of these influences combined in a simple, blues-based song structure that was fast, danceable, and catchy. The first wave of rock & rollers -- Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly, Bo Diddley, Bill Haley, Gene Vincent, the Everly Brothers, and Carl Perkins, among many others -- set the template for rock & roll that was followed over the next four decades.

    "jazz": "Jazz is a genre of music that originated in African-American communities during the late 19th and early 20th century. Jazz emerged in many parts of the United States of independent popular musical styles; linked by the common bonds of European American and African-American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz spans a range of music from ragtime to the present day\u2014a period of over 100 years\u2014and has proved to be very difficult to define. Jazz makes heavy use of improvisation, polyrhythms, syncopation, and the swung note, as well as aspects of European harmony, American popular music, the brass band tradition, and African musical elements such as blue notes and ragtime. A musical group that plays jazz is called a jazz band.While New Orleans jazz has improvised ensembles, when jazz started becoming popular in the 1920s and demand was growing for larger dance bands, it became necessary for ensembles to be written down, particularly when a group included more than three...

The artists wore heavy makeup and often outrageous costumes. It heavily influenced the second style below, and the UK punk revolution of 1976. Poppy heavy metal music popular throughout the later 1980's and the first part of the 1990's. Vocals are usually harmonized and the songs are very accessible by mass audiences.Glam metal, also known as hair metal or pop metal, is a subgenre of heavy metal.

    "big+band": "Should be used to describe recordings by a large orchestra which feature brass sections with multiple trumpets and trombones and a large reed section. A feature is that whole sections (the brass, the reeds) often play some parts of the tune in unison while leaving room for soloists at certain times. This style of orchestra began to be developed in the early 1920s by prominent dance band leaders such as Paul Whiteman and Fletcher Henderson, but the majority of 1920s dance bands were smaller groups and did not play in the \"big band\" style. It was not until 1929/30 or so that the majority of dance bands adopted this configuration (examples are the Casa Loma Orchestra, Mills Blue Rhthm Band, Duke Ellington's Orchestra) and big bands became the norm from the mid-1930s onwards. This style should be use sparingly before about 1930 as while there were other orchestras recorded similar to those led by Whiteman and Henderson (already mentioned) the majority of 1920s dance bands are not \"big bands\". From the 1930s onwards this style can be applied to recordings by any large orchestra. There were both jazz big bands (such as Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Jimmy Lunceford, Count Basie, etc.) and \"sweet\" big bands (such as Freddy Martin, Sammy Kaye, and Guy Lombardo's Royal Canadians). This style is often linked to the \"swing\" style (as in \"big bands of the swing era\") but it is better to avoid use the big band and swing tags together as they do not mean exactly the same thing. In reality not all swing groups were big bands, and some big bands featured small groups made up of star musicians from the larger orchestra (Benny Goodman Trio/Quartet/Sextet, Tommy Dorsey's Clambake Seven, Artie Shaw's Gramercy Five, etc.) and it is these smaller groups which played in the \"swing\" style. A useful distinction is that big band recordings feature large amounts of section work (notably the brass and/or the reeds) while smaller \"swing\" groups were more about featured soloists backed by a rhythm section. The big band style was most  prominent during the 1930s and 1940s but was still very popular up into the 1950s and many big band style recordings continued to be made during the 1960s and later.

Precursor to psychedelic rock, garage rock is characterized by sometimes aggressive and unsophisticated lyrics and delivery, typically using guitars distorted through a fuzzbox.At the time there was no specific label and garage rock was not recognized as a separate genre, but critical recognition in the early 1970s through the release of the the Nuggets compilation albums did much to define and memorialize the style. The term derives from the perception the groups were young amateurs who rehearsed in their family garage, although many were professionals and never played in a garage at all.

    "blues": "Blues was originated in the Deep South of the United States around the 1870s by African-Americans from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs, and spirituals. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \"worried notes\"), usually thirds, fifths or sevenths flattened in pitch are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.Delta blues is one of the earliest-known styles of blues. It originated in the Mississippi Delta, and is regarded as a regional variant of country blues. Guitar and harmonica are its dominant instruments; slide guitar is a hallmark of the style.

    "romantic": "Compared to its predecessors, music from the romantic era is more fluid, emotional, personal, secular, and experimental. It was written more for middle-class audiences, and it heavily influenced film music throughout the 20th Century. Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn and Brahms represent the more conservative side of romanticism, and Berlioz, Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Wagner, Chopin, Debussy, and Holst represent the more experimental side.

    "public+broadcast": "\"Public Broadcast\" is a style under Non-Music, mainly with voice-overs, ads, track mixing, etc.Be careful with releases made for distribution to AFRTS (American Forces Radio and Television Service) stations: 'Transcription' covers the licensing end of the release. It's like the Promo format tag. 'Public Broadcast' covers the content end. It is a semi-meta style in which the recording can contain music, PSA's, promotional material, interviews, and interstitial announcer spoken word sequenced for contiguous broadcast (or a recording of such).Some releases are both, some releases are either or neither. There's definite overlap. The modern equivalent would be a (downloadable) podcast, which Staff has okayed for use under this tag.

    "experimental": "Experimental music consciously deviates from established musical norms (of a particular genre, or of music in general). Music of almost any genre can be considered experimental \u2013 but the term is often associated with the more abstract and challenging strains of electronic music, jazz, and rock. Avantgarde has its own tag.Experimental music might explore new compositional techniques (e.g., John Cage's use of the I Ching, or Steve Reich's process music), new musical forms (but drone and free improvisation have their own tags), unusual instruments (e.g., the theremin, or Harry Partch's homemade instruments), extramusical sounds (e.g., Matmos, but musique concr\u00e8te has its own tag), \"extended technique\" (playing instruments in unusual ways \u2013 e.g., Cage's prepared piano), microtonal scales, minimalism (e.g., lowercase music), unexpected stylistic fusions, abrasive timbres and rhythms, or experiments in any other aspect of music.As such, \"experimental music\" isn't really a single style with a distinct sound. It's more of a sensibility: an effort to explore new musical frontiers, and to expand the boundaries of musical experience.There is major potential for overuse of this tag, which can be thinned out via use of the various others mentioned on this page instead.

    "contemporary+jazz": "Contemporary Jazz is essentially a catch-all term for the various permutations of popular, mainstream jazz of the 1980s and '90s. While those years were certainly not devoid of complex, cerebral jazz recordings, music referred to as contemporary jazz does not usually share those sensibilities, nor is the term generally used to describe music centered around hard bop or the avant-garde. Instead, instrumental contemporary jazz is usually informed by some combination of a) fusion -- often slickly produced, with an emphasis on rock and funk rhythms; b) pop-jazz, with its almost exclusive concentration on memorable melodies; c) smooth jazz, with its primary goal of creating pleasant, mellow textures; and d) crossover jazz and contemporary funk, with their blend of polished production and R&B influences. Not all contemporary jazz artists completely discard improvisation and challenging experimentation, but by and large, most instrumentalists emphasize shiny production, melody, and accessibility. In the realm of vocal jazz, artists may or may not possess an improvisational flair, but in most cases, their recordings attempt to evoke an aura of stylish sophistication, sometimes drawing upon pop and R&B in addition to jazz.

    "folk+rock": "Folk rock is a musical genre combining elements of folk music and rock music. In its earliest and narrowest sense, the term referred to a genre that arose in the United States and the UK around the mid-1960s. The genre was pioneered by the Los Angeles band The Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and Bob Dylan-penned material with rock instrumentation, in a style heavily influenced by The Beatles and other British bands. The term \"folk rock\" was itself first coined by the U.S. music press to describe The Byrds' music in June 1965, the same month that the band's debut album was issued. The release of The Byrds' cover version of Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and its subsequent commercial success initiated the folk rock explosion of the mid-1960s. Dylan himself was also influential on the genre, particularly his recordings with an electric rock band on the Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde albums. Dylan's 25 July 1965 appearance at the Newport Folk Festival with an electric backing band is also considered a pivotal moment in the development of folk rock.

    "classical": "Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music (both liturgical and secular). It encompasses a broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common practice period. The major time divisions of classical music are as follows: the early music period, which includes Medieval (500\u20131400) and the Renaissance (1400\u20131600); the Common practice period, which includes the Baroque (1600\u20131750), Classical (1750\u20131830) and Romantic (1804\u20131910); the 20th century (1901\u20132000) which includes the modern period (1890-1930) that overlaps from the late 19th-century, the high modern (mid 20th-century), and contemporary (1975\u20132000) period, the last of which overlaps into the 21st-century.

    "free+improvisation": "Free improvisation is improvised music without any rules beyond the logic or inclination of the musician(s) involved. The term can refer to both a technique (employed by any musician in any genre) and as a recognizable genre in its own right.HistoryFree improvisation, as a genre of music, developed in the U.S. and Europe in the mid to late 1960s. The musical advancements made through improvisation through Free Jazz served as inspiration to European musicians, who then created \"Free Improvisation\" as a differentiation. Exponents of free improvised music include saxophonists Evan Parker, Anthony Braxton, Peter Br\u00f6tzmann and John Zorn, drummer Christian Lillinger, trombonist George Lewis, guitarists Derek Bailey, Henry Kaiser and Fred Frith and the improvising groups Spontaneous Music Ensemble, The Art Ensemble of Chicago and AMM.CharacteristicsIn an atonal context, free improvisation refers to where the focus shifts from harmony to other dimensions of music: timbre, melodic intervals, rhythm and the spontaneous interaction between musicians. Although performers may choose to play in a certain style or key, or at a certain tempo, conventional songs are highly uncommon in free improvisation; more emphasis is generally placed on mood, texture or more simply, on performative gesture than on preset forms of melody, harmony or rhythm. These elements are improvised at will, as the music progresses.At the same time, Free Improvisation is a problematic term. It is neither free nor improvised as in their strict definitions. Musicians who play free improvisation develop highly individualized musical vocabulary which are then played without the restriction of a score. In this sense, the freedom implied by the term Free Improvisation is more of an aesthetic of playing towards notions of freedom than freedom in the pure sense.As it has influenced and been influenced by other areas of exploration, aspects of modern classical music (extended techniques), noise rock (aggressive confrontation and dissonance), IDM (computer manipulation and digital synthesis), minimalism and electroacoustic music can now be heard in free improvisation.

    "jazz-rock": "Jazz-rock may refer to the loudest, wildest, most electrified fusion bands from the jazz camp, but most often it describes performers coming from the rock side of the equation. Jazz-rock first emerged during the late '60s as an attempt to fuse the visceral power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational fireworks of jazz. Since rock often emphasized directness and simplicity over virtuosity, jazz-rock generally grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late '60s and early '70s: psychedelia, progressive rock, and the singer/songwriter movement. The latter drew from the mellower, more cerebral side of jazz, often employing vocal as well as instrumental improvisation; this school's major figures included Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, and Tim Buckley. Most jazz-rock, however, was played by higher-energy rock ensembles. Some of them were more jam-oriented, borrowing jazz harmonies and instruments for their extended, rock-flavored improvisations (Traffic, Santana). Others recorded jazz-flavored R&B or pop songs that used the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic sensibilities of jazz, but weren't as interested in improvisation or instrumental virtuosity (Blood, Sweat & Tears, Chicago, Steely Dan). Still others used jazz's complexity to expand rock's musical horizons, not just in terms of instrumental technique but in crafting quirky, challenging, unpredictable compositions (Frank Zappa, the Soft Machine). The major exception was Miles Davis, the first jazz musician since the early R&B era to covet the earthy power of rock & roll and the impact it had on young audiences. Starting with 1970's Bitches Brew, Davis' early-'70s fusion workouts -- greatly inspired by Jimi Hendrix and Sly & the Family Stone -- quickly became some of the funkiest, edgiest, most aggressive jazz-rock ever recorded. While figures like Zappa and $Steely Dan continued to record jazz-rock through the '70s, the movement had essentially dissipated by the '80s, as a mellower form of fusion captured its audience.Not to be confused with Jazz-Rock Fusion: https://www.discogs.com/style/fusion Most Collected Jazz-Rock Music Explore More Popular Jazz-Rock Music Aja Steely Dan 0 0 0 The Royal Scam Steely Dan 0 0 0 Pretzel Logic Steely Dan 0 0 0 Gaucho Steely Dan 0 0 0 Hot Rats Frank Zappa 0 0 0 Chicago Transit Authority Chicago Transit Authority* 0 0 0 \u2605 (Blackstar) David Bowie 0 0 0 Jazz-Rock Artists Miles Davis 0 0 0 Santana 0 0 0 Frank Zappa 0 0 0 Chicago (2) 0 0 0 John McLaughlin 0 0 0 Soft Machine 0 0 0 Blood, Sweat And Tears 0 0 0 Early Jazz-Rock Releases Explore More Early Jazz-Rock Music The Beat Red Prysock And His Orchestra 0 0 0 In The Mood Ernie Field's Orchestra* 0 0 0 Easy Dancing Noel Chibous And His Orchestra* 0 0 0 Mack The Knife Volume 2 Bobby Darin 0 0 0 Boogie Woogie / To Each His Own Danny Welton 0 0 0 Rock, Rock, Rock Georgia Gibbs 0 0 0 Ronnie Cord Ronnie Cord 0 0 0 Jazz-Rock Music Releases by Decade Top Submitters of Jazz-Rock Music Most Sold Jazz-Rock Releases This Month Explore More Trending Jazz-Rock Music Gaucho Steely Dan 0 0 0 Moonglow Tatsu Yamashita* 0 0 0 Moonflower Santana 0 0 0 Gaucho Steely Dan 0 0 0 Roots Ian Carr's Nucleus* 0 0 0 African Rock Akira Ishikawa & His Count Buffalos* 0 0 0 Japanese Jazz Spectacle Vol. I (Deep, Heavy & Beautiful Jazz From Japan 1968-1984) Various 0 0 0 Related Styles of Music Fusion Prog Rock Jazz-Funk Psychedelic Rock Pop Rock Blues Rock Contemporary Jazz Experimental Avantgarde Funk Folk Rock Soul-Jazz Art Rock Classic Rock Free Jazz",
    "vocal": "Although nearly all pop music involves sung vocals, in Vocal pop music, there is an exceptional emphasis on a virtuosic, solo vocal performance which carries almost the entire melody. The backing music is often a relatively simple accompaniment by chords in a lower register, although it can include lush orchestral or big-band arrangements as well. Rhythm sections tend to be very subdued, if present at all.Record shops and collectors typically use the term Vocal in reference to mainstream, \"white\", \"adult\" English-language pop music of the 1950s and 1960s: mainly ballads and standards which continue the tradition of vocal jazz, without the improvisational elements. The style's peak coincided with the early rock & roll era, after which most Vocal pop became regarded as \"easy listening\" music, but it continues to enjoy waves of popularity throughout the world to the present day.On Discogs, perhaps due to unfamiliarity with the style, the Vocal tag is not used so strictly. It is found on all kinds of pop releases from all eras, whenever a vocal solo dominates the performance. However, it should not be used on just any pop music with vocals. It is inappropriate for especially highly rhythmic pop or music which is better tagged with a regional style such as Chanson (French-language vocal pop) or a style under the Folk, World & Country genre.

Its roots are in 1950s' American rock and roll when and where it first started, itself heavily influenced by rhythm and blues and country music.
